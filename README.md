## T-Rexxer Bitcrusher
![](/Screen_Shot.png)

T-Rexxer is an open-source bitcrusher plugin made using JUCE Projucer, for our Music Software Devlopment 2 course.

Our plugin, named “The T-Rexxer”, is a simple bitcrusher plugin designed to distort and overdrive sounds. It’s a very basic and easy to use plugin with big clear buttons and dials with obvious effects, so anyone can use it without needing prior knowledge or experience. It has two parameters - ”dry / wet” and “Bit Rate”. These do exactly what their names imply - “dry / wet” decides the rate of the original audio to the audio affected by the T-Rexxer plugin, while “Bit Rate” increases and decreases the amount of bit depth of the audio, resulting in a distortion effect. 

A bitcrusher is a particular low-fidelity effect that lowers the bit depth and sample rate of the audio. This means the amount of data in the audio sample and the rate at which the samples of audio are played back is lower, resulting in a lower resolution of audio (Piper). While normally a decrease in audio quality might be undesirable, but to a creative mind and in the right hands this can make for a really cool effect.

The concept for our plug-in was inspired by dinosaurs and the sounds they make, particularly the tyrannosaurus-rex. Dinosaurs are awesome, and the idea is to make audio sound more like a dinosaurs’ roar - that is a heavy, gritty, and distorted sound. The resulting effect is to somewhat imply that the t-rex is singing his music in a heavy and angry way. The graphics of the interface is designed to reflect this idea, with a big angry t-rex to the side of the knobs against the metal background. Straight away without knowing that the plugin exists, any beginner or newcomer to the T-Rexxer will be able to infer what it does simply by looking at the interface.
